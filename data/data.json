We find that the gradients coming from head items dominate the overall gradient update process, which further affects the optimization of tail items. Furthermore, we propose a general framework namely Cluster-Wise Multi-Objective Training (CMT) for long-tail recommendation, which is featured with popularity disentanglement, cluster-wise multi-objective optimization, and robust contractive regularization."

To solve the problem of repeat consumption, we propose GRASER, which utilizes graph neural networks (GNN) and an encoder-decoder structure to make recommendation. The session sequence is first converted to the session graph, then the encoder generates the session representation by two attention networks, and the decoder disintegrates it into three components, i.e., status, repeat and explore, to make recommendation under different circumstances and optimize repeat consumption."

We propose an attentive intersection model for TRS, to address the above issues. The intersection between user and item tags is exploited to enhance the learning of conjunct features. Finally, the user and item representations are concatenated and fed to factorization machines (FM) for score prediction."
